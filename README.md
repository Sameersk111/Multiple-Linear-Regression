# Multiple-Linear-Regression
Multiple linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to model the relationship between multiple predictor variables (also called independent variables or features) and a continuous response variable (also called the dependent variable or target variable). It extends the concept of simple linear regression, which models the relationship between a single predictor variable and the response variable, to include multiple predictors.

The goal of multiple linear regression is to fit a linear equation to the data that best explains the relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable. The linear equation takes the form:

Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₚXₚ + ɛ

where:

Y is the response variable
X₁, X₂, ..., Xₚ are the predictor variables
β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₚ are the regression coefficients (also called the model parameters) that represent the relationship between each predictor and the response
ɛ is the random error term
The coefficients β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₚ represent the change in the response variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding predictor variable while holding all other predictors constant.

To estimate the coefficients, the algorithm employs a method called ordinary least squares (OLS), which minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed response values and the predicted values from the linear equation. The OLS method finds the coefficients that provide the best fit to the data.

In practice, before performing multiple linear regression, it is essential to check assumptions such as linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals to ensure the validity of the model and the accuracy of the statistical inferences.

Once the model is fitted, it can be used to make predictions on new data by plugging in the values of the predictor variables into the linear equation. Additionally, the coefficients can be interpreted to understand the relationships and relative importance of the predictors on the response variable.

Multiple linear regression is a widely used algorithm in various fields, including finance, economics, social sciences, and many others, to analyze and predict the behavior of continuous outcomes based on multiple input variables.
